        <p>I created a map for the world populations using a js provided by the website geojson.xyz. With this I was able to set the variable up equal to the geoJSON popplace calling it the variable names. This allowed me to create the circleMarkers that I needed. I set the colors in here to blue and green and created a stroke with the number zero, allowing for it to be strokeless. I then set the other color outside to blue so that way when there was a stroke on the mouseout, it could be distinct. On the radius I set it up to the function getRadius which I have created using people, divided and math.pi. For divided I set it up to the number 1000 because of the size of the circles without this number. These circles became too large to see on the map. When I added in this number, the circles became easier to see and to click on. I filtered through name in order to return the features and then moved onto oneachFeature. In doing this I was able to set up a contrasting color of red along with a stroke variable which I set to blue up above in order for there to be a big contrast in the circle the user was able to select. On mouseout I was able to set the circle back to a strokless state and back to green. This allowed for the circle to return ba38.443932, -45.755052ck to normal. I was also able to create a name variable for the names that were needed for the popups throughout the maps popups as well as the number of their max population.</p>
